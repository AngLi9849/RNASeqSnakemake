# Position is considered as relative to the sequenced nucleotide (interpreted based on sample sequenced strand and pair-end-ness)
# 5 and 3-truncations (trunc) accept 0 or positive integers
# Single Nulceotided Position (sn_pos), 1-based integers, blank or zero means not single nucleotide, positive means 5' position, negative means 3' position, intepreted per sample based on read strandedness and paired-end
